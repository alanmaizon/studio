    summary: 'Learn the basics of keeping your indoor plants happy and healthy with this comprehensive guide.',
    content: '<p>Caring for houseplants can be incredibly rewarding. This guide covers the essentials: lighting, watering, soil, and common issues. We\'ll help you choose the right plants for your space and skill level.</p><h3>Light</h3><p>Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect light. South-facing windows are often too intense, while north-facing windows might not provide enough light. East or west-facing windows are usually ideal.</p><h3>Watering</h3><p>Overwatering is a common mistake. It\'s generally best to let the top inch or two of soil dry out between waterings. The specific needs will vary by plant type.</p>',
